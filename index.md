## LARGE-SCALE DEEP LEARNING: TRENDS and APPLICATIONS
### with Invited Guest Speakers from Samsung â€“ ISC 2018

Speakers: Rangan Sukumar, Aaron Vose, Jacob Balma, Hars Vardhan, Schuyler Cullen, and Vish Rajalingam

### Abstract
Deep learning adoption in the industry is a journey that begins with identifying appropriate datasets and use-cases, investing in curation and creation of appropriate labels that map to monetizable business problems, building a team of data and machine learning scientists that are capable of designing algorithms that train fast and accurate models, and supporting the team with a performant and productive compute infrastructure.

This workshop brings together experts and practitioners that are leveraging supercomputing principles and best practices for real-world in-production use-cases to present their experience and valuable lessons. The workshop will offer a platform for exposition of how deep learning use-cases in industry are evolving, open-challenges in training deep networks at scale, the state-of-the-practice in hyper-parameter optimization, shortcomings of existing datasets and methods, and emphasize system design choices which maximize both productivity and performance.
